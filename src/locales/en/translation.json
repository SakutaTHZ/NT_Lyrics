  "aboutNtLyrics": "About NT Lyrics",
  "ntlyricsDescription": "began as a humble Facebook page — created out of necessity to help beginner musicians navigate the often messy world of Burmese music chords. Back in the early days, finding accurate chords and lyrics for local songs was more about guesswork than guidance. That frustration gave birth to this project. What started as a few shared posts quickly gained traction. Musicians, singers, and hobbyists began using and contributing, turning the page into a quiet but growing hub. Today, NT Lyric n Chord is a dedicated space — built not just to host lyrics and chords, but to make playing and learning music feel accessible for everyone. We’re not a corporation, and we’re not some faceless aggregator. This project is run by people who play music too.",

                About NT Lyric n Chord
              </h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                <strong>NT Lyric n Chord</strong> began as a humble Facebook
                page ‚Äî created out of necessity to help beginner musicians
                navigate the often messy world of Burmese music chords.
                <br />
                <br />
                Back in the early days, finding accurate chords and lyrics for
                local songs was more about guesswork than guidance. That
                frustration gave birth to this project.
                <br />
                <br />
                What started as a few shared posts quickly gained traction.
                Musicians, singers, and hobbyists began using and contributing,
                turning the page into a quiet but growing hub.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, NT Lyric n Chord is a dedicated space ‚Äî built not just to
                host lyrics and chords, but to make playing and learning music
                feel accessible for everyone. We‚Äôre not a corporation, and we‚Äôre
                not some faceless aggregator. This project is run by people who
                play music too.

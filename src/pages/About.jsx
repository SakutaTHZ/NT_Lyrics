              🎸 About NT Lyric n Chord
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>NT Lyric n Chord</strong> began as a humble Facebook page — created out of necessity to help beginner musicians navigate the often messy world of Burmese music chords.
              <br /><br />
              Back in the early days, finding accurate chords and lyrics for local songs was more about guesswork than guidance. That frustration gave birth to this project.
              <br /><br />
              What started as a few shared posts quickly gained traction. Musicians, singers, and hobbyists began using and contributing, turning the page into a quiet but growing hub.
              <br /><br />
              Today, NT Lyric n Chord is a dedicated space — built not just to host lyrics and chords, but to make playing and learning music feel accessible for everyone. We’re not a corporation, and we’re not some faceless aggregator. This project is run by people who play music too.

              We keep things simple but consistent. Here’s how to understand the structure:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm md:text-base">
              <li>
                <strong>🔤 Chord Placement:</strong> Chords appear <em>above</em> the lyrics at the exact point they should be played.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>🪕 Common Markings:</strong>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-1">
                  <li><code>(*)</code> — Indicates chorus repetition.</li>
                  <li><code>[Intro]</code>, <code>[Verse]</code>, <code>[Chorus]</code> — Structural parts of the song.</li>
                  <li><code>{'//'}</code> — Used for transliteration or repeated lines.</li>
                  <li><code>Capo: 2</code> — Use a capo on the 2nd fret.</li>
                  <li><code>(x2)</code>, <code>(x4)</code> — Repeat a section this many times.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>📝 Translations & Notes:</strong> Some songs include Romanized lyrics or rhythm guidance for clarity.
              </li>
